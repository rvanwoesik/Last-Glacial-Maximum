This study hindcast the geographic distribution of 18 Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral species, 
with different sensitivities to modern heat stress, into the last glacial maximum (LGM), some 18,000 years ago, 
when sea-surface temperatures were 2â€“4oC cooler and sea level was ~130 m lower than on contemporary reefs.
